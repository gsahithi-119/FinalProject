# FinalProject

# To Do
- Ensure that Python is installed
- Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed: Pandas, Matplotlib, SKLearn, numpy, transformers, torch
- Download the project code from the repo and unzip the file
- Run the project in Spyder or a similar IDE
- A link starting with 'http://' will be returned in the console; go to that link
- In the website, navigate to the "Test" tab
- Enter the text in the text box and see the results

# Objectives:
- To design and implement a website that allows the user to upload a news article and then informs the user the probability (percentage) that 
  the given article is fake news. 
- Reach approximately 70% accuracy with hte model. 
- To learn how to use and understand machine learning models, understand pandas, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow. 
- To learn how to implement a website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript on replit. 
- To practice using Object Oriented Programming style. 
- To learn how to handle user errors. 

# Deliverables:
- A website that allows users to enter a news article and returns the likelihood that their news article is fake, determined using machine learning through python programming. 
- A completely updated README file, containing documentation of the programming process and instructions for use. 
- Screenshots displaying the results of entering various news articles and the results that the program gives. 

# Usage:
- User enters a piece of news text (as text, not a file) into the website submission textbox on the submissions page.
- Program analyzes and returns the probability that the news text is fake.

# Contributions:
- Find and train a machine learning model.
- Integrate backend Python with frontend HTML/CSS.
